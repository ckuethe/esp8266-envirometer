Someone asked me (during the pandemic) if I had a non-contact thermometer.
I said "I don't, but I have enough stuff in my junk drawer to build one."

I either have the weirdest junk drawer ever, or a perfectly normal one
considering that I'm posting about this on github...

Main parts used for this build:
* Wemos D1 Mini
* DS3231 RTC
* BME280 Pressure/Temperature/Humidity sensor
* MLX90614 IR sensor
* SSD1306 OLED
